            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>
                    &emsp;I'm an undergraduate computer science student at Boise State University. I'm interested in all kinds of development, from web design, 
                to software, to games. <br>
                &emsp;My currently expected graduation date is December 2021,
                and I recently accepted an internship position at Paylocity for the summer of '21.
                <br><br>&emsp;Look around to learn more about me, or find me <span class="contact-inline">elsewhere.</span>
                I'm always looking to make new connections, so don't be afraid to reach out!

                    &emsp;I have lived in several places throughout the Pacific Northwest, but I currently (and happily) call Boise, Idaho home. 
                    I started my college journey at University of Idaho, but part way through, transferred to Boise State. 
                    And I'm glad I did, as I've fallen in love with the campus and the Boise area, and hope to spend many more years here.<br>
                    &emsp;Because of my personal identity and interest 
                    in community-building, I co-founded BSU's <a href="https://engage.boisestate.edu/organization/qstemclub" target="_blank">Queer STEM Club,</a>
                    which aims to provide social and academic support to other LGBT+ students in STEM. Running a club post-COVID has been hard, 
                    but I'm reminded that it's worth it every time we're able to help another person.<br>
                    &emsp;In my free time, I enjoy testing out new plant-based and gluten-free recipes, spending time with my feline sidekick, 
                    and working on personal projects, whether that be art, writing, or a game. I'm always down to watch a movie/show that's 
                    "so bad it's good." My most recent watch
                    (and one I whole-heartedly recommend): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)" target="_blank">Hackers(1995)</a>.
